# Insurance-Business-Statistics

This dataset provides a snapshot of medical insurance charges and relevant policyholder information from an insurance provider in the U.S. It contains records for over 6,000 beneficiaries, with key variables including age, gender, body mass index (BMI), number of dependent children covered, smoking status, geographic region of residence, and individual insurance charges.

The purpose of analysing this data is to uncover relationships between policyholder demographics, risk factors, and incurred medical costs. The charges variable represents the total dollar amounts billed to insurance for each beneficiary, which serves as a proxy for their healthcare expenditures. Exploring this variable in relation to factors like age, BMI, tobacco usage, dependents, and location can provide insights into how these attributes impact insurance claims. This can help inform actuarial practises around customised pricing and risk management. Additionally, understanding the drivers of medical costs can aid in the development of targeted wellness initiatives. Overall, careful examination of this multi-faceted dataset can assist the insurance company with financial forecasting, pricing optimisation, risk mitigation, and population health management.

# Objectives
1. Do smokers file higher insurance charges compared to non-smokers?
2. Does the BMI of females differ from the BMI of males?
3. Is the proportion of smokers significantly different across different regions?
4. Is the mean BMI of women with no children, one child, and two children the same?
